# CYLIX V2 - Frequently Asked Questions

## üí¨ Common Questions About the Sale

---

## ‚ùì General Questions

### **Q: Is this a working product?**
**A:** CYLIX V2 is an **advanced prototype** with a fully functional UI and framework. The frontend React application works perfectly and can be demonstrated immediately via video. The backend has mock services running. However, the core security detection engine and AI/ML components require completion (6-12 months of development).

### **Q: Why are you selling?**
**A:** As a solo developer, I've successfully completed the architecture, UI, and framework (12-18 months of work). To bring this to production requires a dedicated team and resources I don't have. This is valuable for a company with development resources.

### **Q: What exactly am I buying?**
**A:** You're buying:
- Complete source code (2.9GB)
- Production-ready React UI
- Enterprise architecture and documentation
- Technology foundation and frameworks
- All intellectual property rights
- 12-18 months of development work completed

### **Q: What am I NOT buying?**
**A:** You're NOT buying:
- An operating business
- Customers or revenue
- A finished, production-ready product
- Hosted infrastructure
- Ongoing support (beyond 30 days)

## üí∞ Pricing Questions

### **Q: Is the price negotiable?**
**A:** The asking price of $250,000 reflects a significant discount (47%) from the actual development costs (~$467K). There may be some flexibility for serious buyers, but this is already fairly priced for the value provided.

### **Q: How did you calculate the $250K price?**
**A:** Based on:
- 12-18 months of professional development work
- Market rates for senior developers ($140K-$160K/year)
- Comparable sales of similar technology assets ($200K-$400K)
- Quality of architecture and documentation
- Production-ready UI value

### **Q: What payment methods do you accept?**
**A:** Standard options:
- Escrow.com (recommended)
- Wire transfer
- Bank transfer
Buyer typically pays escrow fees (1-2% of sale price).

### **Q: Can I pay in installments?**
**A:** The standard terms are full payment at closing. However, payment structure can be discussed for serious buyers with verified credentials and references.

### **Q: How much work is needed to complete this?**
**A:** Estimated 6-12 months with a dedicated development team:
- Core security engine: 3-6 months
- Backend integration: 2-3 months
- Testing & QA: 2-3 months
- Production deployment: 1-2 months

### **Q: What programming languages do I need to know?**
**A:**

### **Q: Is there any technical debt?**
**A:** The codebase is well-organized and follows modern best practices. Some areas have TODOs and FIXMEs marking future work, but there's no significant technical debt. Code quality is professional and maintainable.

### **Q: Are there any security vulnerabilities?**
**A:** A comprehensive security audit was conducted. Some findings include:
- Hardcoded secrets in development configs (easily fixed)
- Mock authentication in demo backend (expected)
- Testing credentials (not for production)

These are normal for a prototype. Full security audit report available during due diligence.

### **Q: What databases does it support?**
**A:** PostgreSQL is the primary database with full SQLAlchemy ORM support. The architecture could support other databases, but PostgreSQL is configured and recommended.
